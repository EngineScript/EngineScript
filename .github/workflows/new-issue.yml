            Thanks for opening an issue in EngineScript! üöÄ

            To help us better understand your issue, please run the following command on your server:
            ```bash
            es.debug
            ```

            This command will generate a detailed report including:
            - System information
            - Software versions
            - Configuration settings
            - Service status
            - Network information

            ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Privacy Note**
            Before sharing the debug output, please review and **remove any sensitive information** that you don't want to share publicly. This may include:
            - IP addresses
            - Hostnames
            - Domain names
            - Usernames
            - Passwords or API keys (though `es.debug` tries to avoid these)

            The debug report is saved to a file (the path will be shown when the command finishes) and formatted specifically for GitHub.
            After reviewing and sanitizing the content, please **edit your original issue description** to include the debug output, or paste it in a new comment below.

            We'll review your issue soon!
