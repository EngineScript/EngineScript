# HIGH_SECURITY_SSL controls the SSL certificate keylength for all new domains.
# 0 = Normal security (EC-256, 256-bit ECDSA certificate, fast and secure for most sites)
# 1 = High security (EC-384, 384-bit ECDSA certificate, stronger encryption, slightly slower, recommended for high-security environments)
#
# If unsure, leave as 0. Set to 1 only if you require maximum SSL strength.
