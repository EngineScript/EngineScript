# Brotli

# Cloudflare now supports Brotli to the origin.
# Cloudflare will respect your compression level, which can go to 11 if you plan on using brotli_static.
# However, leave brotli_static disabled unless you absolutely know what you are doing and have a system in place to regenerate the compressed files.
# If you do not, you will have issues with serving stale files when wordpress and its plugins have been updated.

# text/html is always compressed by Brotli, but this may change in future module releases.
