### Added
- MariaDB installation testing to GitHub Actions component build matrix
- Redis installation testing to GitHub Actions component build matrix
- Individual MariaDB-specific test job with configuration validation
- Individual Redis-specific test job with connectivity testing
- New workflow dispatch options for mariadb-only and redis-only test scopes
- Standardized base setup for all CI tests including core packages and full dependencies
- Comprehensive dependency installation using both setup.sh core packages and depends-install.sh

### Changed
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflow to use only Ubuntu 24.04 runners for all build and test jobs
- Removed Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 from CI/CD test matrix to focus on latest LTS support
- Standardized all workflow jobs (validate-scripts, component-build-test, nginx-specific-test, full-build-test, report-results) to use ubuntu-24.04
- Updated artifact naming to reflect single Ubuntu version in build logs
- Improved component build test matrix to include ['dependencies', 'nginx', 'php', 'openssl', 'mariadb', 'redis']
- Unified CI environment setup with consistent dependency installation across all component tests
- Enhanced test reporting to include MariaDB and Redis specific test results

### Fixed
- Missing MariaDB component testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Missing Redis component testing in CI/CD pipeline  
- Inconsistent dependency installation across different component tests
- Eliminated duplicate dependency installation code in component tests

### Technical Details
- Component tests now install both core packages (from setup.sh) and full dependencies (depends-install.sh) consistently
- Each component test builds upon a standardized EngineScript environment foundation
- MariaDB tests include both installation and configuration validation
- Redis tests include both installation and connectivity testing
- All tests maintain proper timeout handling and error reporting
- Build logs are uploaded for all component tests for debugging purposes

## 2025-01-27

### Changed
- **Simplified CI workflow to focus exclusively on Nginx compilation testing**
- **Renamed workflow from "EngineScript Build Test" to "EngineScript Nginx Build Test"**
- **Reduced build timeout from 180 to 120 minutes for focused Nginx testing**
- **Removed PHP, MariaDB, and Redis build steps and verification from CI workflow**
- **Updated verification and reporting steps to only check Nginx component status**
- **Streamlined PR comments to report only Nginx build results**
- **Updated artifact naming from "full-build-logs" to "nginx-build-logs" for clarity**
- **Removed unnecessary directory creation for PHP, MariaDB, and Redis configurations**
- **Simplified final status check to only validate Nginx build success**
- **Modified test summary generation to focus on Nginx component only**

### Removed
- **PHP build and verification steps from CI workflow (not needed for core functionality testing)**
- **MariaDB installation and verification steps from CI workflow**
- **Redis installation and verification steps from CI workflow**
- **PHP-specific directory creation and configuration checks**
- **MariaDB-specific directory creation and credential management setup**
- **Multi-component status tracking and reporting complexity**

### Technical Details
- CI workflow now provides faster feedback by testing only the most critical component (Nginx)
- Simplified workflow structure reduces maintenance overhead and potential CI failures
- Focus on Nginx compilation ensures the most complex build process is thoroughly tested
- Removed components (PHP, MariaDB, Redis) can still be tested manually or in separate workflows if needed
- Nginx build remains the most comprehensive test of EngineScript's compilation capabilities

## 2025-01-29

### Added
- **Enhanced debugging for CI script execution hangs**
- **Comprehensive environment checks before script execution**
- **Package manager preparation and lock removal in CI environment**
- **Script existence and permission validation before execution**
- **Enhanced error reporting with detailed log output for failed scripts**

### Fixed
- **Fixed CI script hanging by adding enhanced debugging to Remove Preinstalled Software step**
- **Added EUID override for CI environment to prevent root check failures**
- **Implemented package manager lock removal and process cleanup**
- **Enhanced script timeout handling with detailed failure reporting**

### Technical Details
- CI now validates script existence and permissions before execution
- Package manager locks and hanging processes are cleared before script execution
- EUID is explicitly set to 0 in CI environment to bypass root checks
- Enhanced debugging shows exact point of failure when scripts hang
- Timeout failures now provide detailed log output for debugging
