# Default virtual domain file for your Nginx server.
#
# When connecting to this IP, your browser will warn you that the connection is untrusted.
# This is because we've self-signed an SSL certificate for this IP.
# You'll need to tell your browser to allow the invalid SSL cert.

# To connect to the admin control panel, you must have a domain installed on the
# EngineScript server. Once you have a domain, you can connect to the admin panel
# by going to https://admin.yourdomain.com and using the credentials you set
# during installation under the Admin Control Panel Login section.
# You can review the options you set with the console command: es.config
