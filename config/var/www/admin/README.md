# onepager-medium

Live Preview: https://op.1lp.org/medium

Simple (only HTML &amp; CSS), responsive one-pager for small businesses. Minimalist, clean design for longer content. 

It's possible to display smaller image galleries, lists, tables, but also to insert a YouTube/Vimeo video or a Google/Wufoo form.

The template comes with a navigation bar (removable), facilitating jumping between sections (e.g., introduction, services, references, gallery, etc.). However, keep in mind that everything appears on one page, there are no subpages, so let's keep the wording concise. 

It could be ideal for small, individual entrepreneurs who want to quickly and succinctly present their activities to potential clients, but it can also function as an online resume.
